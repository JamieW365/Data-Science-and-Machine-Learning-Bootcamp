## Overview
This repositry contains a number of Jupyter Notebook files developed as part of the Complete 2022 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp found on Udemy. My motivation for this undertaking was to gain a strong foundational knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning methods in my persuit of a career as a Data Scientist. This extensive course contained 40+ hours of video tutorials including coding challenges and project walkthroughs. Using Jupyter Notebook and a number of tools such as Matplotlib, Numpy and Tensorflow we completed a number of real world projects including image recognition, spam classification and property valuation. This has left me with a strong understanding of the methods used to visualise and analyse data using algorithmic logic and the confidence to apply this to further projects beyond this course.
